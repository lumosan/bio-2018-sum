  \subsection*{Behavioral Characteristics}
    \input{vdyn}
    \subsubsection*{09. Gait, Typing Rhythm}
      \textbf{Gait}: How people walk
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Generalities}: Walking is similar for all humans. Non-contact. Uses sequences. Applications: security/surveillance, medicine, forensics. Hard to disguise and perceivable at distance.
        \item \textbf{Features}: Width of silhouette; vertical and horizontal projections; angular representation; PCA and LDA.
        \item \textbf{Feature extraction}: Recognition includes \emph{dynamic} (motion) and \emph{static} (body shape) features.
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Global \emph{motion} and \emph{shape}
          \item Gait \emph{period} and \emph{phase}
          \item Gait model initialisation
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Extended pendular thigh-model based on angles
            \item Forced oscillator/bilateral symmetry/phase coupling
          \end{itemize}
          \item Local contour deformation
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Matching}: DTW and HMM
      \end{itemize}

      \textbf{Typing Rhythm} (keystroke dynamics):
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Generalities}: Way a user types on a keyboard, identity verification is based on how you type. Behavioral, transparent and natural. Can be used on smartphones. Typing pattern may be unique because it's based on neuro-physiological factors (similar to dynamic signature)\\
        Narrow range of applications, need to account for typing errors. Minimal training, no additional hardware.
        \item \textbf{Features}:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Latencies} between succesive keystrokes
          \item \textbf{Duration} of each keystroke
          \item Overall typing speed
          \item Especially consistent features for known regularly-typed strings (e.g. username and password)
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Trigraph features}: 3 consecutively typed keys. \emph{Duration}: (time between first and third key). Feature vector in trigraphs are sorted in ascending duration order.
        \item \textbf{Trigraph matching}: \emph{Degree of disorder} (sum of absolute changes in position between two sorted arrays, normalized to have a value in [0,1])
        \item\textbf{Password hardening} -- Text password + Typing pattern\\
        More security, but also high false rejects (e.g. change of keyboard).
      \end{itemize}
  \subsection*{Biological Traces}
    \subsubsection*{10. DNA}
      \textbf{Generalities}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Biological traces}
        \item DNA \textbf{unique} to every individual, only shared by \textbf{identical twins}. Can be obtained from many sources. Does not change during life, but can be damaged by chemical and physical events and by random mutations.
        \item Invasive collection of samples. Money and time expensive. Privacy concerns?
        \item Requires \textbf{tangible} physical sample and matching is not done in real-time. Currently not completely automated.
        \item \emph{Biological background}: All cells of an organism contain same DNA content. A \textbf{chromosome} is the visible state of genetic material. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Genes are made of \textbf{DeoxyriboNucleic Acid} (DNA).\\
        \textbf{DNA}: Double helix is the natural form in which DNA is found within nucleus of the cells. DNA is a polymer (long string of simple repeating units). Repeating units are called \textbf{nucleotides} (four types: \textbf{A}denine, \textbf{C}ytosine, \textbf{G}uanine, \textbf{T}hymine). The complete DNA molecule consists of two of these strands of the four bases.
        \item Components:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Nucleotides
          \item Hydrogen bonds (electrostatic connection): A-T; C-G
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}

      \textbf{Concepts}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Most DNA is the same accross people, but some varies: \textbf{Short Tandem Repeats (STRs)} in non-coding sequences.
        \item \textbf{Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)} -- Method of amplifying a specific region of the genome (from 1 to over 1 Billion copies)
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Locus} -- region of the genome being examined \todo[inline]{??}
          \item \textbf{Allele} -- State of the genetic variation being examined. STRs is the nb. of repeat units, SNPs is the base sequence at the site.
          \item Chromosomes are \textbf{paired}: Homozygous (Heterozygous) -- Alleles identical (differ) on each chromosome
          \item \textbf{Process}:
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item DNA molecule with target sequence is heated to denature it
            \item When the mixture cools, primers bond to the single stranded DNA
            \item dNTPs and DNA polymerase are added to synthesize two new strands of DNA
            \item Process is repeated, many copies can be produced in a short time
          \end{enumerate}
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Short Tandem Repeats (STRs)} -- Length Variation\\
        These repeat regions usually bounded by specific \emph{restriction enzyme} sites $\Rightarrow$ possible to cut out segment of chromosome
        \item \textbf{Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)} -- Sequence Variation; insertions/deletions
        \item \textbf{Capillary Electrophoresis} -- Separates the fragments by drawing them towars a positively charged pole. Shortest fragments move faster, therefore their order reflects their size. Laser light activates the fluorescent tags as the fragments pass a detection window, producing a color readout that is translated into a sequence.
        \todo[inline]{ddNTP? Locus? watch a video on this whole thing? :/}
      \end{itemize}

      \textbf{DNA Analysis steps}:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Collection: Blood, saliva, semen, urine, hair, teeth, bone, tissue
        \item Specimen Storage
        \item Extraction
        \item Quantitation
        \item Genotyping
        \item Interpretation of results
        \item Database (storage and searching)
      \end{enumerate}

      \textbf{Applications}:
        Forensics, Paternity testing, Historical investigations, Missing persons investigations, Mass disasters
  \subsection*{Synthetic Biometric Data Generation}
    \subsubsection*{11. Synthesis of Fingerprints}
      \textbf{Synthetic Fingerprint Generation}: To automatically create large databases of fingerprints, allowing to train, test, optimize and compare algorithms. Collecting fingerprints is expensive (money and time) and problematic (privacy legislation).
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Select  $\rightarrow$ Obtain:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item shape parameters $\rightarrow$ \textbf{fingerprint shape}

        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Ridge pattern} generation, to obtain \textbf{master} fingreprint
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Gabor filters iteratively applied to an initially white image, enriched with a few random points. Orientation and frequency of the filters are locally adjusted according to directional and density maps.
          \item As a result, realistic minutiae appear at random positions.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Add \textbf{variability} data:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Determine contact region and erosion/dilation (low-pressure or dry/high-pressure or wet)
          \item Skin deformation
          \item Noise and rendering
          \item Translation and rotation

      \end{itemize}

      \textbf{Classification of biometrics}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Unimodal} (\emph{most restrictive}) -- subset of a unibiometric system that uses a single instance (snapshot), a single representation and a single matcher for recognition
        \item \textbf{Unibiometric} -- uses a single biometric identifier
        \item \textbf{Multi-biometric} -- uses more than one independent biometric identifier (e.g. fingerprint and face)
        \item \textbf{Multimodal} (\emph{most general}) -- superset of a multi-biometric system that may use more than one correlated biometric measurement (e.g. multiple impressions of a finger)
      \end{itemize}

      \textbf{What to integrate?}:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Multiple sensors} for same biometric (e.g. optical and solid-state sensors for fingerprints)
          \item \textbf{Multiple biometrics (traits)} -- Each sensor senses a different biometric. Improves system accuracy and matching speed
          \item \textbf{Multiple samples} of same biometric, e.g. multiple impressions of the same finger

                \item \textbf{Rank Level} -- Consolidates the ranks associated with every subject. Highest rank (best rank assigned to an individual by any of the classifiers); Borda count (number of identities whose ranks are worse than the individual's rank)
                \item \textbf{Decision Level} (combine identity decisions, \emph{least informative}). Possible schemes: AND, OR, majority voting\\
                \emph{Support Vector Machines} find the hyperplane that gives the largest minimum distance to the training samples
              \end{itemize}

        \item Evaluation should be carried out using a relevant population database
        \item Performance characteristics (e.g., Tippett plots I and II as well as Proportions Trade-Off (PTO) plot)
        \item Performance metrics provide a single numerical value that describes the performance in terms of e.g., accuracy, discriminating power, etc. of the LR method (e.g., probabilities of misleading evidence (PME$H_0$ and PME$H_1$), equal proportion probability (EPP))

      \textbf{Why standards?} For interoperability and data interchange between applications and systems. Included are: APIs, file formats, biometric templates, template protection techniques, related application/implementation profiles, methodologies for conformity.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Interoperability
        \item Vendor independence
        \item Cost effectiveness
        \item Increased competition
        \item Reduced risk
      \end{itemize}

      \textbf{Standardisation Bodies}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Industry}:\\
        Industry Consortia: BioAPI, BC (Biometric Consortium)
        \item \textbf{National} Standardization Bodies:\\
        ANSI (American National Standards Institute), SNV (Swiss Association for Standardization)
        \item \textbf{International}:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item ISO/IEC (International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission)
          \item ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization)
          \item EU: CEN/ISSS (European Committee for Standardization (Comité Européen de Normalisation)/ Information Society Standardization System)
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
      \textbf{Biometrics Based Standards} -- \emph{Subcommittee 37 (SC37) on Biometrics}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Established by ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) in June 2002
        \item an international venue to accelerate and harmonize formal international biometric standardization
        \item to ensure that future standards based systems and applications are more interoperable, scalable, reliable, usable, and secure
        \item \textbf{Working Groups} (WG):
        \begin{itemize}
          \item WG 1 -- Harmonized Biometric Vocabulary and Definitions (what we mean by the words)
          \item \textbf{WG 2 -- Biometric Technical Interfaces (how data is transferred in a biometric system)}. \emph{BioAPI} is intended to provide a high-level generic biometric authentication model suited for any biometric technology. Covers Enrollment, Verification, and Identification. Includes a database interface to allow a biometric service provider (BSP) to manage the identification population for optimum performance. Also provides primitives for Capturing on a client and Enrollment, Verification, and Identification on a server.\\
          Benefits:
            \begin{itemize}
              \item Easy substitution of biometric technologies
              \item Use of biometric technology across multiple applications
              \item Easy integration of multiple biometrics using the same interface
              \item Rapid application development - increased competition (tend to lower costs)
            \end{itemize}
          \item \textbf{WG 3 -- Biometric Data Interchange Formats (how biometric characteristics are encoded in an interoperable way)}.\\
          \emph{Projects:}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item 19794-1 -- Framework

            \item 19794-15 -- Hand Crease Data
          \end{itemize}

          \emph{Layers of standards:}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Layer 1}: Data Formats -- The Biometric Data Block (BDB). Defines formats for the digital representation of measurements of various physical characteristics. Can be \emph{images} and/or extracted \emph{features}.
            \item \textbf{Layer 2}: Meta-data -- Common Biometrics Exchange File Format (CBEFF) is an emerging standard for sharing biometrics in raw signal or template form. The standard is recommended for interchange between different components of a system or across systems.\\
            \textbf{Biometric Information Record} (BIR) is an encapsulating unit for storage and transfer of BDBs and consists of BDB + Metadata. \emph{Enrolment} is capturing biometric data into a BIR and storing it.\\
            Data described by CBEFF includes:
            \begin{itemize}
              \item Security information in the form of digital signatures and data encryption
              \item Identification of biometric type
